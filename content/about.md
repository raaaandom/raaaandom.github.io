Hi, I'm @raaaandom\
an italian CS student who's particularly overenthusiastic about computers and japan.

Here's a non-exhaustive list about my interests:
 - Videogames (any genre)
 - Programming
 - Music (Mostly metal, indie and breakcore)
 - Reading
 - 日本語
 - Urbex (WIP)

I'm currently studying Computer Science at the [Alma Mater Studiorum University](https://www.unibo.it/en) of Bologna.\
In my free time I enjoy studying japanese (JLPT N5) and wasting time on videogames, while complaining about having too many interests and not finding time to pursue them all.
