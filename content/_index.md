This is @raaaandom's web blog. (that's me :D)\
In this website you can find posts about my hobbies, projects and personal achievements.

The main reason this blog exists is to motivate me in my projects: it's not that rare for me to drop everything after 1 week from the start.\
With this, i aim to fix this bad habit of mine while also trying to reach out to people who share common interests with me.

Get to know me better in the [/about](./about) section (uwu?)\
or jump straight into action in either the [/posts](./posts) or [/projects](./projects) section.
